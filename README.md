# meo-wifi-login-js

Allows for an automated login through a `Meo Wifi` hotspot.

Based on [meo-wifi-login](https://github.com/ravemir/meo-wifi-login) for Python.


## Why this project? (and what's `Meo Wifi`) ü§î

Firstly, `Meo Wifi` is a set of thousands of hotspots, that `Meo` (a portuguese telephone provider) clients have access.

Unfortunately, their `Captive Portal` is a little bad, so this package wants to skip that step.

My main motivation with this is another (yet private) project.

## API üìñ

#### meoWifiLogin

The main function, used to login on the `Meo Wifi Captive Portal` and get access to the Internet.


```javascript
function meoWifiLogin: (username: string, password: string, ip: string) => Promise<loginResponse>;
```

|Parameter|                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
|username | the `Meo`'s account e-mail                     |
|password | the `Meo`'s account password                   |
|ip       | the current device IP inside `Meo Wifi` network|

##### Response

```typescript
interface loginResponse {
	success: boolean;
	// true  = connect
	// false = error on connection

	response: {
		result: boolean; // equal to success
		error: string | null; // reason of the error
		RedirectUrlEN: string;
		RedirectUrlPT: string;
	}

	statusCode: number; // HTTPS response status code
	url: string; // Url requested to login
	cryptoPassword: string; // encrypted password to login
}
```

#### meoWifiLogoff

If you want to close the access to the Internet and logout from the `Meo Wifi Captive Portal`.


```javascript
function meoWifiLogoff: () => Promise<logoffResponse>
```

##### Response

```typescript
interface logoffResponse {
	success: boolean;
	// true  = connect
	// false = error on connection

	statusCode: number; // HTTPS response status code
	url: string; // Url requested to login
}
```

#### encryptPassword

This is the core of all this project, this function "emulate" the `Meo Wifi Captive Portal`, encrypting the IP and the user password.

```javascript
function encryptPassword: (password: string, ip: string) => string;
```

|Parameter|                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
|password | the `Meo`'s account password                   |
|ip       | the current device IP inside `Meo Wifi` network|

##### Response

The function return a Base64 string that can be used on the login Url.

##### How it works

For this function, I extracted the `iv` (Initialization Vector) and the `salt` from `Meo Wifi Captive Portal` javascript.

Next we create a `key`, with `PBKDF2`:

```javascript
const key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(
	ip, /*Message to cryptograph*/
	salt,
	{ keySize: 8, iterations: 100 }
)
```

And finally create the encrypted password with AES:

```javascript
const crypto = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(password, key, { iv })
crypto.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64) // Encrypted Password
```

## Thanks üôèüôè

If this project is working is thanks to [@ravemir](https://github.com/ravemir) that writes [meo-wifi-login](https://github.com/ravemir/meo-wifi-login) for Python. If I understood how `Meo Wifi Captive Portal` cryptographs passwords was reading his project.
